\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
Optical mark recognition (\ac{omr}) is a ubiquitous technology whenever large amounts
of controlled physical data needs to be converted to a digital form. This is an
especially common task in the field of education, where the scoring of dozens to
hundreds of multiple choice tests is a regular need. Manual grading of such
examinations is a mundane and time-consuming task that can be easily avoided
with the use of \ac{omr}, as the submission format is completely controlled.
\section{Existing Solutions}
Many of the most popular \ac{omr} solutions presently available are prohibitively
expensive. The most popular product available, sold by Scantron, consists of a
proprietary scanner that is only compatible with Scantron sheets. The scanner
alone can cost several thousand dollars, and the sheets present a continuing
cost for as long as the scanner is in use.

An increasing interest in open educational resources (\ac{oer}) has led to the
development of several free and open source solutions, such as: FormScanner,
queXF, and Auto Multiple Choice. These softwares work extremely well, however,
they have failed to become mainstream due to their increased complexity. Thus,
there exists a need for a simple, free solution that can be implemented with
minimal training or setup time.
\section{Proposed Solution}
A simple, freely available software and mark sheet pair is proposed. By
providing a freely available mark sheet in printable form, setup time is reduced
to the time it takes to download and print the file. In addition, a simple,
easy-to-use software utility that prioritizes reliability will encourage
educators to make the transition from proprietary solutions to an open and free
one. The software will remain simple while still providing a competitive feature
suite and will act as a bridge between raw exam results and more full-featured
exam analysis software.
\subsection{Requirements}
Based on the problem analysis and proposed solution, the final product should:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Be freely available and open-source
  \item Be as reliable as possible in order to produce fair results
  \item Process files in bulk
  \item Be simple and easy to learn and use
  \item Sort results
  \item Output files that can be input into analysis software
  \item Require minimal setup
  \item Be immediately understood by students taking exams
  \item Provide readily available training resources for educators
  \item Complete processing of results in reasonable amount of time
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Design of Multiple Choice Sheet}
The multiple-choice sheet is the physical piece of paper that all students
taking exams will fill out. It is also known as a `bubble sheet', easily recognized
by many due to its grid of circles that must be filled in to input answers. In order to
develop a reliable solution with minimal setup, only one sheet is supported
by the software. Therefore, this sheet must be highly optimized.

In order to ensure that the entire solution is freely available to all
educators, an entirely new multiple-choice sheet was developed for use.
This new sheet balances optimization for optical mark recognition with
user-friendliness.
\section{Design Overview}
The optical mark sheet designed for this project consists of several sections,
or `fields'. Several fields provide empty boxes for students to write in their
answers. This provides the administrator with a means to rapidly identify tests
and verify student information. The completed design is shown in
\itemref{fig:sheet}. A full printable version is given in \sectionref{sect:sheet}.

\fig{Final multiple-choice sheet design.}{sheet.png}{fig:sheet}

The sheet consists of a `student information' section and an `answers' section,
divided by a location for student signatures. The following fields are
included:
\begin{description}
  \item[Last Name] For the student's last name. Space for 12 alphabetic
  characters is provided.
  \item[First [Name]] For the student's first name. Space for 6 alphabetic
  characters is provided.
  \item[Middle [Name]] For the student's middle name. Space for 2 alphabetic
  characters is provided\footnote{It is expected that any students who have a
  middle name will likely have a middle name longer than two characters; this
  is considered acceptable as the middle name is used primarily for sorting.}.
  \item[Student ID] For any ID number that identifies students. This could be an
  official institutional ID or simply a number given by the administrator. Space
  for 10 numeric digits is given.
  \item[Course ID] For an ID number that identifies the course. Again, this
  could be official per the institution, or a number generated by the
  administrator to identify the course and section. Space for 10 numeric digits
  is given.
  \item[Test Form Code] The optional test form code matches exam results with
  their corresponding answer keys. As described in \sectionref{sect:scoring}, this can
  be a single character or multiple.
  \item[Signature] An informal (unprocessed) field is provided for the exam-
  taker's signature. This does not affect results in any way.
  \item[Date] An informal (unprocessed) field is provided for the date. This is
  intended to pair with the Signature field and thus does not affect results
  either.
  \item[Answers] The core of the multiple-choice sheet is the set of up to 75
  multiple-choice answers to fill in. The test designer can choose to use
  anywhere from 1 to 75 questions, with answers A-F (or any combination of 2 or
  more of those), as described in \sectionref{sect:scoring}.
